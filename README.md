# Kickstarter Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how other fundraising campaigns performed in relation to to their launch date and fundraising goals. Only campaigns similar to Louise's were included when drawing conclusions from the data. 

### Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed by filtering out any data that wasn't relevant to our focus campaign, reducing our pool to only theatre related campaigns and then observing how they performed in relation to their launch date. Then the data was filtered even further to include only plays and then their success in relation to their fundraising goal was observed.

While not having any particular challenges that I felt like I couldn't overcome, some more difficult concepts at first were correctly formatting the pivot tables and also correctly formatting the COUNTIF() function.

### Conclusions
According to the data, while the number of failed and canceled theatre fundraising campaigns hovered in a tight range regardless of the time of year, the highest number of successful campaigns were launched in the Summer, particularly May and June. The lowest number of failed campaigns were launched in Novermber, but November was also one of the months to experience the fewest number of successful campaigns. In relation to their initial fundraising goal, the highest number of plays had targets between $1000 and $5000. Fundraisers in that same range experienced the highest success rate as well at 72.66%. 

Some potential limitations with the dataset include a lack of information about how the fundraising campaigns were marketed to potential backers. The success of a fundraising campaign is highly dependent on exposure to the inviduals that are willing to make a donation. 

Other useful charts tables/charts would include a table and including the number of backers in relation to successful campaigns, so that the relationship between the number of donors and the success of a campaign can be observed. Also, a chart including the three different subcategories within "theatre" and how their success/failure rates relate to each other.
